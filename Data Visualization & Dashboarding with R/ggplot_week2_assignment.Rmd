Your objective is to replicate these figures, created using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study data. These figures are similar to those we completed in the lecture videos.

### Put your name here: LAU LOUIS KIN PONG



## Exercise 1

Hints:

* For the x-axis, use the variable "ideo5".

* Make sure you recode the data for the "ideo5" variable to generate the correct names for the x-axis. You will want to consult the codebook.

* Use the fill aesthetic to have R fill in the bars. You do not need to set the colors manually.

* Use guides() to drop the legend.

* Make sure the axis labels and figure title are correct.


```{r exercise1,echo=FALSE}


```

## Exercise 2

Hints:

* For the x-axis, use the variable "pew_religimp".

* Make sure you recode the data for the "pew_religimp" variable to generate the correct labels for the x-axis. You will want to consult the codebook.

* Rename the column for Ideology to make sure the first letter is upper-case (to make the legend appear correctly).

* Use the fill aesthetic to have R fill in the bars. You do not need to set the colors manually.

* Make sure the axis labels and figure title are correct.

```{r exercise2,echo=FALSE}

## Exercise 3

Instructions:

* For this visualization, you are creating your own data for practice.

* Create a tibble/data frame with three columns: Semester, Student, and Grade.

* There should be six semesters and three students (Amanda, Betty, and Carol)

* Create grades for the students using the runif() command, with values between 80 and 100. Hint: you'll need 18 grades total.

The figure should look approximately like this (your vaules will be slightly different):
